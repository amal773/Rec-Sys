# User-Based Collaborative Product Recommendation System

## Problem Statement
Building recommendation system for online movie streaming platforms like Netflix.

## Description
In this project, we will implement a user-based recommendation model for Netflix. User-based collaborative filtering involves analyzing user behaviors and preferences to recommend content. The model will identify users with similar viewing habits and suggest movies or TV shows based on what similar users have enjoyed. This personalized approach aims to enhance the viewing experience by providing tailored recommendations for individual users within the Netflix platform.
